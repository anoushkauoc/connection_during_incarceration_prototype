# Connection During Incarceration — Prototype

A lightweight, public-facing prototype that communicates a policy/product concept to support family connection during incarceration. Built as a static site for quick iteration, easy sharing, and portfolio-style review.

This prototype illustrates:

The problem: communication barriers during incarceration and the downstream impacts on families

The concept: structured prompts, low-friction activities, and “relational infrastructure” to support healthier contact

The user experience: a simple flow that makes the idea tangible (without requiring a backend)
